Data Structure  : It is way in by which we can store data in efficent way

Primitive Data Structure : bit, byte, short, int,long, float,double , boolean,Char
No-Primitive Data Structure :
Linear Data Structure : String , Array, Stack , Queue, LinkedList
Non-Linear Data Structure : Tree, SET , Graph

We can use primitive data type for small application but for enterprise level we need No-Primitive Data Structure

Why  Collection FrameWork :
The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the
group of objects.
Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching,
sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.
Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces
(Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)

What is Collection in Java
A Collection represents a single unit of objects, i.e., a group.

What is a framework in Java
It provides readymade architecture.
It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
It is optional.
What is Collection framework
The Collection framework represents a unified architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It has:

Interfaces and its implementations, i.e., classes
Algorithm

The java.util package contains all the classes and interfaces for the Collection framework.
