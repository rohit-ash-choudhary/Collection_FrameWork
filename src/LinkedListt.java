   LinkedList :
            LinkedList is a implemented class of List Interface , that present in Java.util.*;

            Syntax :
              LinkedList inherit List and Deque interface.
              Class LinkedList Implements List, Deque (clone ,serializable too)
              {
                  //Constructor
                  //Method
              }
           -- The Underline data structure of LinkedList is doubly Linkedlist and Circular LinkedList


Disadvantage and Advantage of LinkedList :
       Advantage of LinkedList
                    - Insertion and Deletion was too fast but In Double Link list I am directory added the Node.
                        (No need to shift element index like ArrayList)
                    - We can traverse in both forward and backward Direction
      Advantage of LinkedList :
                    - it occupay extra space for previous node address
                    - if Insertion and Deletion in between then handle previous and next node

Properties of LinkedList :
            - LinkedList was index based data structure.
            - Store heterogeneous data types
            - follow insertion order but not follow sorting order
            - Stored duplicate elements
            - LinkedList was non-synronized  data types
            - No provide data consitant gaurantee.
